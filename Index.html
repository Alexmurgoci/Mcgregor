  <h1>CONOR MCGREGOR</h1>
  <hr size="2">
   <p><em>Conor McGregor</em> rose from a tough neighborhood to become the biggest star in the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA).<br>
    After joining the <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)</strong> in 2013, "The Notorious"<br>
    unified the featherweight division with his title win in 2015,<br>
    and the following year he became a two-division champion by winning the lightweight title.<br>
    McGregor also famously fought boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017.<br>
    He abruptly retired from MMA in March 2019, before returning with a victory in January 2020.</p>
